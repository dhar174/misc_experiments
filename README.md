# misc_experiments
This repository serves as a collection of experimental scripts and utilities, mainly in the realm of machine learning. It features a wide array of topics including attention mechanisms, softmax approximations, landmark-based algorithms, and more. 

##NOTE: These scripts are experimental WIPs and are provided as is. Some may not work correctly, and are provided as exploratory starting points for my own research.
